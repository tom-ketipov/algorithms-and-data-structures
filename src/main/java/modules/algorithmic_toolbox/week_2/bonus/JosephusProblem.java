    2.3.1 Josephus Problem
    Find the position of the survivor in the vicious series of killings described by Flavius Josephus, the first-century historian and head of Jewish forces in Galilee.

    Input: Natural numbers n and k. They represent n rebels standing in a circle. Rebels are being eliminated in such a way that every k-th still alive rebel around the circle
    is killed until only one rebel left. Rebels are killed clockwise starting from rebel 0, i.e., rebel k âˆ’ 1 is killed first.

    Output: The position of the survivor, denoted Josephus(n, k).
